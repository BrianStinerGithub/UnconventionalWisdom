### Working Script

**Holding a wad of cash, hear a printer, see a printer in light, talk to camera**

What is money? Can it be defined with paper, or cloth, or digits in your bank account?
How is it personal, business, and government property all at the same time?
We see and feel that it motivates work, gets us material comfort, and that enough of it holds power.
Knowing how to use money can be the difference between insane luxery and deadly poverty.
So why does almost no one know about how it works? Even trained economists will say they're guessing.
Why don't we talk about how its structured in public, when it clearly isn't working correctly. We are not benifiting from this economy.
That rich groups manipulate financial powers without regard to their responsibility only thinking of their own profits. 

**Home price, education price, car price, food price**

When prices inflate, our money is affected without it needing to move. What happens to everyone effects us all.
When home prices double we still need homes, when college endebts our children we feel scared but go along with it.
No price is too high for a good education. When we need a car to live and car prices get higher every year.

**Back to the red money printer holding food in hands**

When food... FOOD gets more expensive EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Who is affecting the total supply of money to cause this inflation?

**Cut in to face slowly**

Thats the only way to get inflation. There is more money now. But if you look at the federal printed supply of money you see that its been really stable for a long time.
Except for that huge spike in recent years which to every economists suprise didn't cause a huge wave of inflation. For some reason it didn't seem to be enough.
If we overlay inflation on this we can see it doesn't match. So who making money other than the government?

**Cut back to wide with no money to be seen**

To explain where all this extra money is coming from and where all this extra money is going, I need to ask you, where is your money right now?

**Cameraman pulls out phone, turns it around**

Nooo, thats not where your money is. Thats just a readout of what the bank owes you if you wanted to cash out. When you put cash in your get an IOU from the bank.
Everyone with a bank account will accept an IOU from the bank just as easily as real money but in the end its still a debt. 
We know that banks make loans, and that they make far more loans than they have saved in the vault. 
When those loans are issued the bank doesn't move money from anyone's account to make the loan, they create the loan like particles at the start of the universe.
Matter and anti-matter come from nothing. The bank issues you a bank account balence of $10,000 and you sign a document with a value of at least $10,000 dollars.
Which is two positives, $20,000 printed and ready to spend, without any government influence. This means the reserve ratio is meaningless since money isn't loaned out from anyone's savings.
It's created when we get in debt and destroyed when we pay it back.
So where is your money? 

**Pulls out cash**

Ah, see here your money really is here. You for sure know where it is, for now.
The issue is that this printed money still ruins the buying power of this money over time.
Money, even if its in your possesion, is never really yours. It is always a share of the whole pie, and if that whole is growing your share shrinks in relation.
Plus its hardly money at all. You can't spend this online. Good luck buying a home in cash. It still works for most of the economy but technologically it can't keep up.
This used to be the main way we exchanged value, then it was with checks, then with cards, now with apps. Going back to cash is a hassle now.

**Scary I know**

So what are we supposed to do with this information, I hear you ask across the electric void. 
Bank accounts aren't real money, the government has ultimate control, and cash can't keep up.
That the government can print away becuase it lost control of money printing a long time ago.
The banks rule the economy.
Well I'm not just telling you all this to depress you!
I'm telling you theres an alternative!

We have a currency that is set to upset the traditional idea that you need a bank account to work and live.
Its not controlled by banks or government, no fees, no crashes, and it doesn't inflate at 2-3% per year.
You may think I'm talking about Bitcoin, but I'm not. If you have even heard of Bitcoin.
The internet right? You searched up this video, saw the title and thumbnail, you're watching it right now.
This video is really here! Not only that but its available to everyone, its fully public. 
But what if I wanted to send you money? Then I would have to send it only to you and verify that it was real.
Currently we have millions of humans watch over that process. We figuired out how to have machines do it instead.
A system where every machine that participates helps manage the responsibility and humans have machines in their pockets.
If you own a phone you don't need a bank. 
We have some issues. We need to make conversion of your funds easier. We need to see broad adoption.
You need to understand that when you come into this space you are rejecting the old and embracing the new even when many others are struggling to transfer over.
People struggling to understand why conversion is neccesary. 
Happy to keep having their money drained by a bloated system when machines can do it for free over the internet.
Million of people are unbanked, leaving them prey to the check cashing, money cards, and payday loans. 
They make money off the flaws in the system, so a new system without flaws, without profit, is a threat to their lives. 
How do we get them using crypto as soon as possible? They are suffering right now and we can fix it!
Online money without banks!

The main issue with cryptocurrencies is that economies happen in real time. Most people don't understand how to use crypto, crypto isn't exactly human friendly, and if you don't look to far into it government fiat sits in the background just working. You have to ignore how it doesn't work but people live in a bubble of their own reality so some are impenetrable. 

Wait no I'm talking about how banks print money. or really poof money into existence and you pay for their cheating on your behalf. If you use it responsibily to build more wealth for yourself it could work out in the end, but for most loans they just increase the price and make you pay for it longer. Its not helping anyone.

When you get a loan in crypto it is more akin to an earlier idea of a loan, like lending real cash. You lose access to it and they gain access. 
No new money is created from nothing. No chance for government policy to destroy the country like with hyperinflation of the past.
