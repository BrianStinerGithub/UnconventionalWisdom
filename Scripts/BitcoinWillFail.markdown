### Working Script


Does the institutional adoption of bitcoin by big players like Blackstone, Morgan Stanley, Tesla, and PayPal signal the new age of effortless value transfer or does this hide that bitcoin has been corrupted by big money forces and become the evil it sought to cure? 

My conclusion? Yes. Stay tuned to find out why. 
To start,  
Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and that cements it in people's minds as the one true cryptocurrency. The only one they know and trust.

If you didn't listen to it on vinyl you didn't really listen to it at all. This is obviously absurd, we have infinite music at our discretion now. A better life through technology!

Technologically, Bitcoin is objectively the worst currency of the bunch with new players like Cardano and IOTA offering real solutions to our online currency problems with scaling, centralization, fees, ease of use, and mass adoption.

Bitcoin was released in 2009 like a virus escaping a laboratory and after the initial drama of being the first in the world digital distributed currency, and lots of in-fighting,
for some reason, the developers have refused to update the blockchain to match user demand leading to the high fees and long wait times we see today.

Now to be fair, put yourself in Blockstreams shoes,
After 80 billion dollars was invested into the company, the developers knew they needed to make profits to pay it back, but how do you make a profit from developing an anti-authoritarian medium of exchange?

How do you make money off money?
The answer? 
You don't. 
You make money off debt.
The Lighting network is the sidechain solution where bitcoins sit in a vault between nodes with IOUs for bitcoins being traded in their place.
It's free to trade IOUs between nodes, but that means we aren't trading money anymore!

This isn't what we were promised! 

To solve blockchain scaling issues the lightning network strips away the blockchain! 

It was a feature, not a bug! 
It was a feature, not a bug! 

If you want to use bitcoin as an exchange of value the only reasonable option would be to use the lightning network, so most bitcoins won't actually move anywhere. 
Not using a cryptocurrency is not the solution to making the cryptocurrency better. 
That's avoiding the problem, or creating a problem, depending on your perspective.

But hey, maybe I'm being too harsh. It's digital gold, it'll never lose value.

Let's talk about the supply of bitcoins, or more specifically, the supply of cryptocurrencies.
Due to the law of supply and demand, as the number of bitcoins created from each epoch slows down the price will naturally rise. 
People like stability and will continue to hold their bitcoins, even when it starts to mold from age in their hands they continue to hold.
As bitcoin production slows down other cryptocurrencies with better features and robustness will fill the gap.

Here is what Ray Dalio said in a recent article:

**Grey out to 50% and type text as read from the paper in my hand.

> I should clarify what I said about its supply. Although Bitcoin is limited in supply, digital currencies are not limited in supply because new ones have come along and will continue to come along to compete with the supply of Bitcoin-like assets. Competition should, and competition will play a role in determining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices.
 In fact, I assume that better ones will come along and displace this one because that is the way the evolution of everything works—i.e., new ways of doing things and new things always have and always will replace old ways of doing things and old things. 
Since the way Bitcoin works is fixed, it won’t be able to evolve and I presume that a better alternative will be invented and pass it by.
 A quote by Ray Dalio

Competitively, bitcoin has fallen behind the pack with its only saving grace being ** it's brand recognition.** 
**Room zooms off to the lower third to reveal a shining bitcoin, then read off in a fun voice each of the reasons bitcoin sails. Memes on stonks raising to the upper third**

> Rising inflation and the potential for even more stimulus continue to push people to safe-haven assets.
> Increased adoption from payment applications like PayPal will give far more people easy access to cryptocurrency.
> Publicly traded companies purchasing Bitcoin show a high level of confidence in its appreciation.
> Bitcoin's historical trend of closely following its halving stock-to-flow model shows an ambitious and extremely bullish outlook.

The only reason anyone would hodl or buy into bitcoin now is to sell them for more later. 
That's not a real currency anymore. The lightning network isn't real currency anymore.
All anyone ever talks about is bitcoins price, or its future price, and not bitcoins features. 
That and they want to talk about bitcoins failures and how it's being solved sometime in the future.
It's a speculation market, just like the tulip craze of 1637. What happened in 2017 was the bear trap, a fake crash before the bubble explodes.Bitcoin is ancient tech and bound to fail, it simply can't adapt. Every day a huge percentage of our global electricity is consumed to solve problems for computers.

Your bitcoin is supposed to offer p2p value transfer without centralization and without fees.

But bitcoin has been twisted from its ideals of the blockchain and the distributed ledger and punk-rock when it became a millionaire-printing machine.

But all good things must come to an end, and if there is one certainty in life it death.

Bitcoin will also crumble to dust when traditional cryptography is quantumly hacked out of existence.
Quantum computers are getting official, and in 20 years we don't want our monetary system destroyed by rogue researchers. 

So we again, can't use bitcoin. 
Don't despair though, if you've been on that unstoppable hype train.
We do have hope, but you'll need to make a change.

None of these issues I've told you about so far exist with newer generations of distributed ledgers like IOTA and Cardano.
They keep power in p2p hands, enable community governance, charge micro-cents or nothing, zero for fees, are intentionally scaling for world domination, and are quantum secure.
They are headed by non-profits researchers who simply want to make the world a better place. Simply want to make the best currency system on earth. Isn't that nice?

Currently, our trouble is getting people to use a distributed ledger system at all,
but soon everyone will be picking the best one for them. 
We'll start sizing up the benefits for us individually and making a choice.

When these next-generation currencies start being used for real transactions across the world and bitcoin still hasn't delivered on its core promises of bringing freedom and democracy to the internet of money, 
people will wake up and abandon ship, selling their digital gold for the real useable money.

If you want to profit from this move your money to a currency that can actually change the world. 
It's only a blockchain age if everyone is using it.
Not just those with disposable income.
Which is the ultimate goal. Let us keep that in mind. 
We all want the same thing, and that's for fiat to be history.
For smaller, more effective government. For local power.
For democracy! For revolution!

If you want to help this channel stay fiat-free you can find public keys in the description, 
and if you have never used cryptocurrency before you can sign up for a Celcius account with my promo code to get $40.

Blockchain isn't just about getting rich or making a better economy, but about making ourselves better as well.
