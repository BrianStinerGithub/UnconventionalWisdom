### Working Script

**Brian standing and speaking into the camera. Upper third of body in frame.**

If your clicked you probably have some bitcoin, and you're suspicious about its future.
Well congratulations, you're right, its not looking great, but maybe a better question is why does its value continue going up?


> Bitcoin broke a key resistance level making investors believe there is further upside.
> Rising inflation and the potential for even more stimulus continues to push people to safe-haven assets.
> Increased adoption from payment applications like PayPal will give far more people easy access to cryptocurrency.
> Publicly traded companies purchasing Bitcoin shows a high level of confidence in its appreciation.
> Bitcoin's historical trend of closely following its halving stock-to-flow model shows an ambitious and extremely bullish outlook.

The only reason anyone would hodl or buy into bitcoin is to sell them for more later.
Its a speculation market, just like the tulip craze. Bitcoin is ancient tech, and bound to fail. 

bitcoin has an artificially low transaction speed.
the company that controls bitcoin is looking for profit, and a lot of it.
your bitcoin is supposed to offer p2p value transfer without centralization and fees.
but bitcoin has been twisted from the ideals of the blockchain and the distributed ledger.

*1* with every passing year bitcoin strays further from its ideals. 
competition in mining pools leads to big players controlling more hash power.
As of now if these two mining pools worked together they could print more bitcoins.

block size is supposed to increase as more users adopt its use. Rather than 5-7 trans/ps bitcoin could have 1000's.
but bitcoin's blocksize has not been increased from its initial 1 mb, when it could be a tb by now.
blockstream plans to sell properly functioning sidechains to fix bitcoin rather than make bitcoin itself functional.
they will charge for this service, and hold your bitcoins for you, just like a bank deposit, in central nodes called hubs.
Us? We trade IOUs for bitcoins. Just like a bank again.

bitcoin will also crumble to dust when traditional cryptography is quantum hacked out of existence.
Quantum computers are getting official, and in 20 years we don't want out monetary system destroyed. 
So we again, can't use bitcoin. We do have hope though.

None of these issues exist with newer generations of distributed ledgers like IOTA and Cardano.
They keep power in p2p hands, charge micro-cents or nothing for fees, they are intentionally scaling for world domination, and they are quantum secure.
When these networks start being used for real transactions and bitcoin still hasn't delivered on its core promise of bringing freedom and democracy to money, people will wake up and abandom ship, hopefully we can exit gracefully before disaster.
Move your money to a currency that can actually change the world. 
Your choice is between 
Cardano: A fractal blockchain
or
IOTA: An adaptive blocktree.
The way to profit now is to vote for the future and bitcoin is past its prime.

The world won't be transacting in satoshis, bitcoin is bust.


> I should clarify what I said about its supply. Although Bitcoin is limited in supply, digital currencies are not limited in supply because new ones have come along and will continue to come along to compete so the supply of Bitcoin-like assets should, and competition will, play a role in determining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices. In fact I assume that better ones will come along and displace this one because that is the way the evolution of everything works—i.e., new ways of doing things and new things always have and always will replace old ways of doing things and old things. Since the way Bitcoin works is fixed, it won’t be able to evolve and I presume that a better alternative will be invented and pass it by. I see that as a risk. For those reasons the “limited supply” argument isn’t as true as it might appear—e.g., if Blackberries were in limited supply they still wouldn’t be worth much because they were replaced by competitors that were more advanced. I still don’t know the answer to why that isn’t a risk, but I would welcome my naïveté being corrected.
