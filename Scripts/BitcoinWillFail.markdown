### Working Script

** Brian standing and speaking into the camera. Upper third of body in frame.
bitcoin has an artificially low transaction speed.
the company that controls bitcoin is looking for profit.
your bitcoin is supposed to offer p2p value transfer without centralization and fees.
The ideals of the blockchain and the distributed ledger.

*1* with every passing year bitcoin strays further from its ideals. 
competition in mining pools leads to big players controlling more hash power.
block size is supposed to increase as more users adopt its use.
but bitcoin's blocksize has not been increased from its initial 1 mb, when it could be a tb by now.
blockstream plans to sell properly functioning sidechains to fix bitcoin rather than make bitcoin itself functional.
they will charge for this service, and hold your bitcoins for you, just like a bank deposit, in central nodes called hubs.

bitcoin will also crumble to dust when traditional cryptography is quantum hacked out of existence.

None of these issues exist with newer generations of distributed ledgers like IOTA and Cardano.
They keep power in p2p hands, charge micro-cents or nothing for fees, they are intentionally scaling for world domination, and they are quantum secure.
When these networks start being used for real transactions and bitcoin still hasn't delivered on its core promise of bringing freedom and democracy to money people will wake up and abandom ship.
Move your money to a currency that can actually change the world. The way to profit now is to vote for the future and bitcoin is past its prime.

The world won't be transacting in satoshis, bitcoin is bust.
