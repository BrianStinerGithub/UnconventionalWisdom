### Working Script

**Brian standing and speaking into the camera. Speaking with authority. Emotional image** 

Does the institutional adoption of bitcoin by big players like blackstone, morgan stanley, Tesla, and paypal signal the new age of effortless money transfer or does it show that bitcoin has been corrupted by big money forces and become the evil is sought to cure? 

Maybe a better question is why is bitcoin's value going up when wider adoption makes the network worse? Is it speculation? 
Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and that cements it in peoples minds as the one true cryptocurrency. 
If you didn't listen to it on vinyl you didn't listen to it. Which is obviously absurd, we have infinite music at our discretion.

**Cutaway to Brian dipping toes into water**

However bitcoin is objectivly the worst currency of the bunch with new players like Cardano and IOTA offering pefect solutions to the online currency problems.
Mainly, scaling, centralization, fees, and ease of use.

**Some kinda cutaway**
Bitcoin was realeased in 2009 like a virus escaping a laboratory, and after the initial drama of being the first in the world digital currency for some reason the developers have refused to update the blockchain to match user demand leading to high fees and long wait times.

**Big numbers barely fit balloon inflating sound effect**
After 80 billion dollars was invested into blockstream, the developers knew profits needed to be made to pay it back, but how do you make a profit off an anti-authoritarian medium of exchange?
How do you make money off money?
The answer? You don't. You make money off debt.
Lighting network is the sidechain solution where bitcoins sit in a vault between nodes with IOUs for bitcoin being traded in its place.
Its free to trade IOUs between nodes but that means we aren't trading money anymore!
This isn't what we were promised! 
If you want to use bitcoin as an exchange the only reasonable option would be to use the lightning network, so most bitcoins don't actually move anywhere. 
Not using a cryptocurrecy is not the solution to making the cryptocurrency better. Thats avoiding the problem, or creating a problem depending on your perspective.

Lets talk about the supply of bitcoins, or more realistically, the supply of cryptocurrencies.
Due to the law of supply and demand, as the number of bitcoins created from each epoch slows down the price will naturally rise even if interest slowed down, which it shows no sign of doing. People like stability and will contunue to hold thier bitcoins, even when it starts to mold from age they continue to hold. As bitcoin production slows down other cryptocurrencies with better features and robustness will fill the gap.

Heres what ray dalio said in a recent article:

> I should clarify what I said about its supply. Although Bitcoin is limited in supply, digital currencies are not limited in supply because new ones have come along and will continue to come along to compete with the supply of Bitcoin-like assets should, and competition will, play a role in determining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices. In fact I assume that better ones will come along and displace this one because that is the way the evolution of everything works—i.e., new ways of doing things and new things always have and always will replace old ways of doing things and old things. Since the way Bitcoin works is fixed, it won’t be able to evolve and I presume that a better alternative will be invented and pass it by. 


**Room zooms off to the lower third to reveal a shining bitcoin, the read off in a fun angelic voice each of the reasons bitcoin sails. Memes on stonks raising to the opper third**
Competitivly bitcoin has fallen behind the pack with its only saving grace being **its brand recognition.** 

> Rising inflation and the potential for even more stimulus continues to push people to safe-haven assets.
> Increased adoption from payment applications like PayPal will give far more people easy access to cryptocurrency.
> Publicly traded companies purchasing Bitcoin shows a high level of confidence in its appreciation.
> Bitcoin's historical trend of closely following its halving stock-to-flow model shows an ambitious and extremely bullish outlook.

The only reason anyone would hodl or buy into bitcoin is to sell them for more later. Thats not a real currency anymore. All anyone ever talks about is bitcoins price and not bitcoins features. They also want to talk about bitcoins failures and how its being solved sometime in the future.
Its a speculation market, just like the tulip craze. Bitcoin is ancient tech, and bound to fail. Every day a huge percentage of our global electicity is consumed to solve problems for computers.

Bitcoin has an artificially low transaction speed. 5-7 transactions per second. Did you know that it could be 5000-7000 instead?
The network had to be born, so bitcoin came into the world with very strong security to keep it safe. It was supposed to grow. 
Now that its bigger but still holding on to its childish its fallen into powerful miner groups competing with blockstream developers. 
They have over the years rejected proposals to increase the blocksize on the grounds that it'll cost more data per second. 
the company that controls bitcoin is looking for profit, and a lot of it.
your bitcoin is supposed to offer p2p value transfer without centralization and fees.
But bitcoin has been twisted from its ideals of the blockchain and the distributed ledger when it became a money printing machine.

Blockstream plans to sell properly functioning sidechains to fix bitcoin rather than make bitcoin itself functional.
Lighting network is one solution that would make deposits of bitcoin into a central location.
We trade IOUs for the bitcoins. This makes our currency more of a bitcoin-backed fiat.
It also removes the distributed ledger recording every transaction. Which was a feature not a bug.

Bitcoin will also crumble to dust when traditional cryptography is quantum hacked out of existence.
Quantum computers are getting official, and in 20 years we don't want out monetary system destroyed. 
So we again, can't use bitcoin. We do have hope though.

None of these issues exist with newer generations of distributed ledgers like IOTA and Cardano.
They keep power in p2p hands, enable community governance, charge micro-cents or nothing for fees, they are intentionally scaling for world domination, and they are quantum secure.
When these networks start being used for real transactions and bitcoin still hasn't delivered on its core promise of bringing freedom and democracy to money, people will wake up and abandom ship, selling their bitcoin to get some of the real useable money.

Move your money to a currency that can actually change the world. 
Your choice is between 
Cardano: A fractal blockchain 
or
IOTA: An adaptive blocktree where each participant validates 2 others.

The way to profit now is to vote for the future and bitcoin is past its prime.

The world won't be transacting in satoshis, bitcoin is bust.

This scramble for altcoins capable of delivering “face-melting” gains has led to a decline in Bitcoin trading volume across South Korean exchanges.
