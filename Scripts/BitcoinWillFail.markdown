### Working Script

**Brian standing and speaking into the camera. Speaking with authority. Emotional action image** 

Does the institutional adoption of bitcoin by big players like blackstone, morgan stanley, Tesla, and paypal signal the new age of effortless money transfer or does it show that bitcoin has been corrupted by big money forces and become the evil is sought to cure? 

Maybe a better question is why is bitcoin's value going up when wider adoption makes the network worse? Is it speculation? 
Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and that cements it in peoples minds as the one true cryptocurrency. 
If you didn't listen to it on vinyl you didn't listen to it. Which is obviously absurd, we have infinite music at our discretion.

**Cutaway to Brian dipping toes into water**

However bitcoin is objectivly the worst currency of the bunch with new players like Cardano and IOTA offering pefect solutions to the online currency problems.
Mainly, scaling, centralization, fees, and ease of use.
Bitcoin was realeased in 2009 like a virus escaping a laboratory, and after the initial drama of being the first in the world digital currency for some reason the developers have refused to update the blockchain to match user demand leading to high fees and long wait times.

After 80 billion dollars was invested into blockstream, the developers knew profits needed to be made, but how do you make a profit off an anti-authoritarian medium of exchange?
How do you make money off money?
The answer? You don't. You make money off debt.
Lighting network is the sidechain solution where bitcoins sit in a vault between nodes with IOUs for bitcoin being traded in its place.
Its free to trade IOUs between nodes but that means we aren't trading money anymore! It means you can charge fees for transfering payments. 
This isn't what we were promised! If you want to use bitcoin as an exchange the only reasonable option would be to use the lightning network, so most bitcoins don't actually move anywhere. 
Not using a cryptocurrecy is not the solution to making the cryptocurrency better. Thats avoiding the problem, or creating a problem depending on your perspective.

Lets talk about the supply of bitcoins, or more realistically, the supply of cryptocurrencies.
Due to the law of supply and demand, as the number of bitcoins created from each epoch slows down the price will naturally rise even if interest slowed down, which it shows no sign of doing. People like stability and will contunue to hold thier bitcoins, even when it starts to mold from age they continue to hold. As bitcoin production slows down other cryptocurrencies with better features and robustness will fill the gap.

Heres what ray dalio said in a recent article:

> I should clarify what I said about its supply. Although Bitcoin is limited in supply, digital currencies are not limited in supply because new ones have come along and will continue to come along to compete so the supply of Bitcoin-like assets should, and competition will, play a role in determining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices. In fact I assume that better ones will come along and displace this one because that is the way the evolution of everything works—i.e., new ways of doing things and new things always have and always will replace old ways of doing things and old things. Since the way Bitcoin works is fixed, it won’t be able to evolve and I presume that a better alternative will be invented and pass it by. I see that as a risk. For those reasons the “limited supply” argument isn’t as true as it might appear—e.g., if Blackberries were in limited supply they still wouldn’t be worth much because they were replaced by competitors that were more advanced. I still don’t know the answer to why that isn’t a risk, but I would welcome my naïveté being corrected.


Competitivly bitcoin has fallen behind the pack with its only saving grace being its brand recognition. 

> Rising inflation and the potential for even more stimulus continues to push people to safe-haven assets.
> Increased adoption from payment applications like PayPal will give far more people easy access to cryptocurrency.
> Publicly traded companies purchasing Bitcoin shows a high level of confidence in its appreciation.
> Bitcoin's historical trend of closely following its halving stock-to-flow model shows an ambitious and extremely bullish outlook.

The only reason anyone would hodl or buy into bitcoin is to sell them for more later. Its not a real currency.
Its a speculation market, just like the tulip craze. Bitcoin is ancient tech, and bound to fail. Every day a huge percentage of our electicity is consumed to solve problems for computers. We need a currency that doesn't consume huge amounts of electricity.

bitcoin has an artificially low transaction speed.
the company that controls bitcoin is looking for profit, and a lot of it.
your bitcoin is supposed to offer p2p value transfer without centralization and fees.
but bitcoin has been twisted from the ideals of the blockchain and the distributed ledger.

*1* with every passing year bitcoin strays further from its ideals. 
competition in mining pools leads to big players controlling more hash power.
As of now if these two mining pools worked together they could print more bitcoins.

block size is supposed to increase as more users adopt its use. Rather than 5-7 trans/ps bitcoin could have 1000's.
but bitcoin's blocksize has not been increased from its initial 1 mb, when it could be a tb by now.
blockstream plans to sell properly functioning sidechains to fix bitcoin rather than make bitcoin itself functional.
they will charge for this service, and hold your bitcoins for you, just like a bank deposit, in central nodes called hubs.
Us? We trade IOUs for bitcoins. This makes our currency more of a bitcoin-backed fiat.

bitcoin will also crumble to dust when traditional cryptography is quantum hacked out of existence.
Quantum computers are getting official, and in 20 years we don't want out monetary system destroyed. 
So we again, can't use bitcoin. We do have hope though.

None of these issues exist with newer generations of distributed ledgers like IOTA and Cardano.
They keep power in p2p hands, enable community governance, charge micro-cents or nothing for fees, they are intentionally scaling for world domination, and they are quantum secure.
When these networks start being used for real transactions and bitcoin still hasn't delivered on its core promise of bringing freedom and democracy to money, people will wake up and abandom ship, hopefully we can exit gracefully before disaster.
Move your money to a currency that can actually change the world. 
Your choice is between 
Cardano: A fractal blockchain
or
IOTA: An adaptive blocktree.
The way to profit now is to vote for the future and bitcoin is past its prime.

The world won't be transacting in satoshis, bitcoin is bust.
