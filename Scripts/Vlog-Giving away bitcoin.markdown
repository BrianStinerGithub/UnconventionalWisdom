So the idea is try to find cool people to hang out with and give them bitcoin.
Would people accept payment with an altcoin?

We are deep in a rabbit hole but we need to come back out and share with the world.

We can give away $1000 of bitcoin to people who are filled with responsibility but have no money.
They will use the currency and force merchants to use it. Reward those that already take it.

Bitcoin would be terrible for this. Can't use a currency with fees.

Need to make sure the wallet they use looks like an updated bank account. New tabs for inventory items. 
A search bar for merchants that take your currency. 
Place to create your ID. 

Contacts. Loans. 
Really nice interest rate.

They gratefully accept the free money and use it even if its weird.
They're lives get better. 

They use the wallet as a savings account. 
They drift away and close their bank accounts.

They convince everyone they meet to switch over.
The rising tide leads to actual revolution.|
We change history.


I'm older than my youth and a future visionary.
Army vet, tech nomad, and cryptorevolutionary.
I see a world working wonders devoting lives to numbers.
Humans sleep cold whenever the banks blunder
no wonder.

Time to rise up and accept our rightful stake.
Owning nothing is not a normal human state.

To provide, as is natural, for me and my family.
we'll create, in a corner,  our communal economy.

We got a group of smart cookies that escaped the cutter
A few sharp wits can cut a big problem like butter.

The center can't hold, the system can't last.
We have to make a plan and we want to act fast
