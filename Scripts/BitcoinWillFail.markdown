### Working Script


Does the institutional adoption of bitcoin by big players like Blackstone, Morgan Stanley, Tesla, and PayPal signal the new age of effortless money transfer or does it show that bitcoin has been corrupted by big money forces and become the evil it sought to cure? 

Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and that cements it in people's minds as the one true cryptocurrency. 

If you didn't listen to it on vinyl you didn't listen to it. This is obviously absurd, we have infinite music at our discretion now. A better life through technology!

Technologically, Bitcoin is objectively the worst currency of the bunch with new players like Cardano and IOTA offering perfect solutions to our online currency problems, which are scaling, centralization, fees, and ease of use.

Bitcoin was released in 2009 like a virus escaping a laboratory and after the initial drama of being the first in the world digital currency 
for some reason, the developers have refused to update the blockchain to match user demand leading to high fees and long wait times.

After 80 billion dollars was invested into Blockstream, the developers knew profits needed to be made to pay it back, but how do you make a profit off an anti-authoritarian medium of exchange?

How do you make money off money?
The answer? 
You don't. 
You make money off debt.
Lighting network is the sidechain solution where bitcoins sit in a vault between nodes with IOUs for bitcoin being traded in its place.
It's free to trade IOUs between nodes but that means we aren't trading money anymore!

This isn't what we were promised! 

To solve blockchain scaling issues lightning network strips away the blockchain! 

It was a feature, not a bug! 
It was a feature, not a bug! 

If you want to use bitcoin as an exchange of value the only reasonable option would be to use the lightning network, so most bitcoins don't actually move anywhere. 
Not using a cryptocurrency is not the solution to making the cryptocurrency better. That's avoiding the problem or creating a problem depending on your perspective.

Let's talk about the supply of bitcoins, or more realistically, the supply of cryptocurrencies.
Due to the law of supply and demand, as the number of bitcoins created from each epoch slows down the price will naturally rise even if interest slowed down, which it shows no sign of doing. People like stability and will continue to hold their bitcoins, even when it starts to mold from age they continue to hold.
As bitcoin production slows down other cryptocurrencies with better features and robustness will fill the gap.

Here is what Ray Dalio said in a recent article:

**Grey out to 50% and type text as read from the paper in my hand.

> I should clarify what I said about its supply. Although Bitcoin is limited in supply, digital currencies are not limited in supply because new ones have come along and will continue to come along to compete with the supply of Bitcoin-like assets. Competition should, and competition will play a role in determining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices.
 In fact, I assume that better ones will come along and displace this one because that is the way the evolution of everything works—i.e., new ways of doing things and new things always have and always will replace old ways of doing things and old things. 
Since the way Bitcoin works is fixed, it won’t be able to evolve and I presume that a better alternative will be invented and pass it by. 

Competitively, bitcoin has fallen behind the pack with its only saving grace being ** it's brand recognition.** 
**Room zooms off to the lower third to reveal a shining bitcoin, the read off in a fun angelic voice each of the reasons bitcoin sails. Memes on stonks raising to the upper third**

> Rising inflation and the potential for even more stimulus continue to push people to safe-haven assets.
> Increased adoption from payment applications like PayPal will give far more people easy access to cryptocurrency.
> Publicly traded companies purchasing Bitcoin show a high level of confidence in its appreciation.
> Bitcoin's historical trend of closely following its halving stock-to-flow model shows an ambitious and extremely bullish outlook.

The only reason anyone would hodl or buy into bitcoin is to sell them for more later. That's not a real currency anymore. All anyone ever talks about is bitcoins price and not bitcoins features. They also want to talk about bitcoins failures and how its being solved sometime in the future.
It's a speculation market, just like the tulip craze. Bitcoin is ancient tech and bound to fail. Every day a huge percentage of our global electricity is consumed to solve problems for computers.

Your bitcoin is supposed to offer p2p value transfer without centralization and fees.

But bitcoin has been twisted from its ideals of the blockchain and the distributed ledger when it became a money-printing machine.

Blockstream plans to sell properly functioning sidechains to fix bitcoin rather than make bitcoin itself functional.

Lighting network is one solution that would make deposits of bitcoin into a central location.

We trade IOUs for the bitcoins. This makes our currency more of a bitcoin-backed fiat.

But this stops the distributed ledger from recording every transaction. 

**Clip transition into whats his face talking about bitcoin**

Which was a feature not a bug.
Which was a feature not a bug.

Bitcoin will also crumble to dust when traditional cryptography is quantumly hacked out of existence.
Quantum computers are getting official, and in 20 years we don't want our monetary system destroyed by rogue researchers. 

So we again, can't use bitcoin. 
We do have hope though.

None of these issues exist with newer generations of distributed ledgers like IOTA and Cardano.
They keep power in p2p hands, enable community governance, charge micro-cents or nothing for fees, they are intentionally scaling for world domination, and they are quantum secure.

Currently, our trouble is getting people to use a distributed ledger system at all but soon we will instead be picking the best one. 
We'll start sizing up the benefits for us individually and making a choice.
When these next-generation currencies start being used for real transactions and bitcoin still hasn't delivered on its core promise of bringing freedom and democracy to the internet of money, people will wake up and abandon ship, selling their bitcoin to get some of the real useable money.

Move your money to a currency that can actually change the world. It's only a blockchain age if we are all using it.
The fees. The fees.
 
Your choice is between: 

Cardano: A fractal blockchain 
or
IOTA: An adaptive blocktree.

The way to profit now is to vote for the future and bitcoin is past its prime.
The world won't be transacting in satoshis, bitcoin is bust.
